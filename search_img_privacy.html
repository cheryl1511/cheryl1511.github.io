    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

    <p>
      Reverse Image Search ("RIMG") provides web, mobile, and browser applications that allow users to perform image-based searches
      by uploading images or entering image URLs. These services are offered free of charge and are intended for use as-is, without
      warranties or guarantees.
    </p>

    <p>
      We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use,
      store, and safeguard your information when you use RIMG. By using our services, you agree to the terms outlined below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use RIMG, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Identifiers</strong> – such as your device’s unique ID, used for security and analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>IP Address</strong> – logged for diagnostics, compliance, and service performance monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Timestamps</strong> – recorded when you interact with the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Log Data</strong> – including device type, operating system version, app version, browser user agent, and crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Uploaded Images</strong> – temporarily stored to enable reverse image searches.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you upload an image, we temporarily store the image on our server, automatically rename it,
        and log the new filename along with your IP address and timestamp.
      </li>
      <li>
        These specific logs related to image uploads are stored only for 45 days, after which they are automatically
        and securely deleted.
      </li>
      <li>If you use an image URL, we do not download, log, or store the image or the URL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain our core search functionality.</li>
      <li>Improve performance, security, and user experience.</li>
      <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Uploaded images are temporarily used to process your search request. They are sent to third-party search engines to retrieve
      relevant results and are deleted from our servers shortly after processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When images are transmitted to third-party search engines, their own privacy and data retention policies apply.
      Please review those policies to understand how they handle your data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Tools and Services</h2>
    <p>
      RIMG uses third-party tools to support functionality, analytics, and advertising. These services may collect data according to their
      own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple App Store – Apple Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>Google Analytics / Google Services – Google Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>Google Firebase – Firebase Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>Lenso.ai - Lensi.ai Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>Microsoft Bing – Microsoft Privacy Statement</li>
      <li>Yandex – Yandex Privacy Policy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your web browser. RIMG and its third-party partners may use cookies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store user preferences.</li>
      <li>Improve user experience.</li>
      <li>Perform analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can disable cookies in your browser settings or use private browsing modes (e.g., Incognito).
      Please note that some features may not function correctly without cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard safeguards to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data transmissions are encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security).</li>
      <li>Data is stored on secure servers with firewalls and access controls.</li>
      <li>We use encryption and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we take all reasonable precautions, no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We retain certain types of log data—such as device information, error reports, and crash logs—for as long as necessary to operate
      and improve the service. Logs generated when a user performs an image search by uploading an image—including the renamed image
      filename, IP address, and timestamp—are retained for no longer than 45 days and then automatically deleted.
    </p>

    <p>This limited retention helps us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor service reliability and prevent abuse.</li>
      <li>Comply with minimal legal obligations.</li>
      <li>Maintain system health and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you'd like to request early deletion of your data (as permitted by law), please contact us.</p>
